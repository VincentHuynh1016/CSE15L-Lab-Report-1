1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
   
If I used the change directory command with no arguments in the terminal then nothing will happen. I will be in the same directory that I am currently in.

2. Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.

If I used the change directory command with a path as an argument then it will take me to that folder/directory. For example I used the cd command and passed in the lecture1 folder as an arguement. After running the command it has changed my directory to that folder. What I can also do is change my directory to folders inside of the lecture1 file.

If I were to use the change directory command with a path to a file as an agrument then it will not work. This is becasue a file is not a directory.
