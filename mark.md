# **cd Command**
---
1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
   
If I used the change directory command with no arguments in the terminal then nothing will happen. I will be in the same directory that I am currently in. For example I used cd in the terminal and I was still in the home directory.

2. Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.

If I used the change directory command with a path as an argument then it will take me to that folder/directory. For example I used the cd command and passed in the lecture1 folder as an arguement. After running the command it has changed my directory to that folder. What I can also do is change my directory to folders inside of the lecture1 file. 

3. Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

If I were to use the change directory command with a path to a file as an agrument then it will not work. This is becasue a file is not a directory. For example when I use cd on the text file then it will not work.

# **ls Command**

1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.

If I were to use the ls command with no arguements then it will show me a list of what folders I can change my directory to. For example I used ls in the terminal and it outputed lecture1, so that means that in my list of folders I can change my directory to lecture1.

2.Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.

If I were to use the ls command with a path to a directory as an argument then it will show me a list of folders in that directory. If I used ls on Lecture1 it will gave me the files and codes inside of the lecture1 folder.

3. Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

If I used the ls command with a path to a file as an argument then it will not work. For example I used ls on the a text file in the terminal. I wrote ls en-us.txt and the output ls: cannot access 'en-us.txt': No such file or directory.

# **cat Command**
---
1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.

When using the cat command without any arguments the terminal waited for me provide my own input from the computer. When doing so and clicking the enter key it would output what I have just typed into the terminal.

2.Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.

If I use the command with a path to a directory as an argument then it would spit out that the path was a directory. For example, if I typed in the terminal cat lecture1, or cat messages after changing my directory to lecture1, the it would output me cat: lecture1: Is a directory and cat: messages: Is a directory.

3. Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

When using the command with a path to a file as an argument after changing into the right directory then it will print out the contents of that file. For example, I am in the directory user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages and if I do the command cat en-us.txt it will print out the content inside that file which is Hello World!
